We all love Josh. This is why we decided to Trolololo him a bit ;)


### Here is how to make sure this works:

Install:

```
Firefox from firefox website ;)
```

```
brew install selenium
```

then make sure you have RVM (http://rvm.io)

```
gem install bundler
```

check out the code and inside the directory:
```
bundle install
```

edit the lets_troll_josh.rb and change the josh_survey_to_troll_public_id to the survey public id that josh sent out
then just run the script :)

```
  ruby lets_troll_josh.rb
```
